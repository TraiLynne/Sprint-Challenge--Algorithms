## Exercise I

a) Constant time `O(c)`- the only value that changes is `a`. Assuming `n` is equal to or greater than 1, multiplying `n` by itself and adding it to `a` will always be a value greater than `n`, the loop will stop after the first go.

b) My guess is Linear `O(n)` or Logarithmic Time `O(log n)` - the number of operations this would take is in direct proportion to `n` because the loop will end when `i` gets to `n`. `n` will stay a constant value, therefore the loop will end. But since there are multiple for loops in there, the number of operations will grow slowly the larger the value of `n`. I will come back to this one ...

c) Linear Time `O(n)` - the number of operations is in direct proportion to n. If I am reading this right, this is basically a countdown from `n` to 0.
